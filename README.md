# Market-Garden-Simulator
The Market Garden Simulator is a professional-grade program designed to simulate the process of cultivating a profitable and diverse garden. With this interactive application, users can experience the joys and rewards of nurturing their own garden while optimizing their profits.

Key features of the simulator include a dynamic plant list, where each plant generates food based on the length of its name. As experienced gardeners know, longer plant names translate to higher market prices, although they may come with a higher initial cost. Additionally, the simulator incorporates a realistic rainfall system, with random daily rainfall amounts impacting food production. In cases of insufficient rainfall, the risk of losing a random plant adds an element of challenge and decision-making.

By wisely managing their resources, users can accumulate enough food to purchase new plants, thus expanding the biodiversity of their garden. However, to promote ecological balance, the simulator enforces a restriction on purchasing duplicate plants.

Experience the serene yet captivating world of gardening, where strategic planning, adaptation to weather patterns, and smart investment decisions are key to thriving in the market garden industry.
